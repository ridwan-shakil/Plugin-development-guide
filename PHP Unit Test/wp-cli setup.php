=================== setup wp-cli globally (One time setup per pc) ======================
Doc: https://make.wordpress.org/cli/handbook/guides/installing/#installing-via-composer

Installing on Windows :

Install via composer as described above or use the following method.

Make sure you have php installed and in your path so you can execute it globally.

Download wp-cli.phar manually and save it to a folder, for example c:\wp-cli

Create a file named wp.bat in c:\wp-cli with the following contents:

        @ECHO OFF
        php "c:/wp-cli/wp-cli.phar" %*

Add c:\wp-cli to your path:

----------------------------
Steps to add C:\wp-cli to PATH (Windows 11)

Open Environment Variables

Press Start → type environment variables → click “Edit the system environment variables”.

In the System Properties window, click Environment Variables… at the bottom.

Edit your PATH

In the User variables section (top half), find Path → select it → click Edit….

(You can also add it to “System variables” if you want it available for all users, but “User variables” is enough.)

Add new entry

Click New → paste:

C:\wp-cli


Click OK to save.

Restart your terminal

Close any open Command Prompt / PowerShell / Git Bash windows.

Open a new one and type:

wp --info
wp --version


If everything’s correct, you should now see WP-CLI info and version output. 🎉
