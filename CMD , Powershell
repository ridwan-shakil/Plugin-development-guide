Core Concepts (CMD vs PowerShell)

CMD        = old-school Windows command line. Simple, fast, but limited.
PowerShell = modern, more powerful, has scripting, works with .NET objects, and is used a lot in automation (also what WP-CLI recommends on Windows).

ðŸ‘‰ As a WordPress dev, youâ€™ll use both sometimes, but PowerShell is more future-proof.
