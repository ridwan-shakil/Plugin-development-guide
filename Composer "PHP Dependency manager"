// In summary, use Composer when your WordPress plugin requires "external dependencies" or
// when you're collaborating on "larger projects".
// However, for simpler projects it might be best to keep things simple and not use Composer unnecessarily.

---------------
Use cases :
---------------
1) Using only built-in autoloader 
2) to load 3rd party libraries without manually downloading them, include and manage the external libraries 
   your plugin needs. This will help ensure that your plugin's dependencies are well-organized and compatible with each other.

---------------
How to use :
---------------
Open VScode/PowerShell run composer init,  
give other info and generate composer.json
Composer.json is the main DNA where we will make changes according to our needs.
The vendor  folder will generate automatically, so don't touch it 
After making changes on composer.json and running the code to regenerate the vendor file =  composer dump-autoload
file_name.php and class name  should have the same name. 
Namespace will have the same name as the "folder/location" in which the file exists 

Write this code in the main plugin.php file 
      if (file_exists(dirname(__FILE__) . '/vendor/autoload.php')) {
      	    require_once dirname(__FILE__) . '/vendor/autoload.php';
      	}

------------------------
now we don't need ( require, includes ) anymore ( Composer Autoloding will handle it )
Now we can just type :
1) use namespace\classname; 
  use sre\classname;
  use src\admin\classname;

2) and than:
  new className();
  new className2();
