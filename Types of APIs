 # 2 types of API : internal & External 

🔹 1. Internal (WordPress Developer) APIs
  👉 These don’t expose HTTP endpoints. Instead, they give you structured ways to interact with WP internals.
  You’ll use these all the time while building plugins.

  •	⭐ Hooks API (Actions & Filters) → Connect your plugin code into WordPress lifecycle.
  •	⭐ Options API → Save & retrieve plugin settings in wp_options.
  •	⭐ Settings API → Create admin settings pages in a standardized way. ( Options + Settings API (to store plugin settings) )
  •	⭐ Metadata API → Store extra info for posts, users, terms, comments.
  •	⭐ Roles & Capabilities API → Control user permissions for your plugin.
  •	Shortcode API → Add [shortcode] functionality for users.
  •	Cron API (WP-Cron) → Schedule background tasks.
  •	Database API (wpdb) → Run custom SQL queries safely.
  •	Filesystem API → Safely read/write files (updates, uploads).
  •	HTTP API (wp_remote_get/post) → Call external APIs.
  •	Transients API → Temporary caching for performance.
  •	Plugin API (activation/deactivation hooks) → Run code when your plugin is activated/deactivated.
  •	Internationalization (i18n/l10n) API → Make your plugin translatable.
  •	Widget API → Add sidebar widgets (less used now, but still around).
  •	Customizer API → Add options into the Theme Customizer (optional).


🔹 2. External-facing APIs
👉 These let outside apps or clients talk to WordPress.
•	⭐ REST API → The modern HTTP API for CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations on posts, users, custom data.
•	(Legacy) XML-RPC API → Older external API, mostly replaced by REST, but still exists.


📌 focus on:
•	Hooks API (to connect your code to WordPress)
•	Options + Settings API (to store plugin settings)
•	Metadata API (to store extra info)
•	REST API (to expose your plugin’s data/functions externally)
•	Roles & Capabilities API (to control permissions)
•	Cron API (for scheduled tasks)
👉 Master these and you’ll cover 90% of what real plugins need.
