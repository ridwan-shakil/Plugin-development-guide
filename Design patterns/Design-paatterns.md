# The Classic 23 (Gang of Four)
Most PHP developers refer to the 23 fundamental patterns described in the seminal book Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software. These are categorized into three types: 

## Creational Patterns (5): Deal with object creation mechanisms.
     Examples: 
          Singleton, 
          Factory Method,
          Abstract Factory,
          Builder, Prototype.
        
## Structural Patterns (7): Focus on class and object composition.
    Examples: 
        Adapter,
        Bridge, 
        Composite,
        Decorator,
        Facade,
        Flyweight,
        Proxy.
## Behavioral Patterns (11): Address communication between objects.
    Examples: 
        Strategy, 
        Observer, 
        Command,
        Iterator, 
        Template Method, State, Memento, Mediator, Chain of Responsibility, Visitor, Interpreter. 

##  Common Non-GoF Patterns in PHP
  Modern PHP development frequently uses additional patterns beyond the original 23, often cited in total counts exceeding 30 patterns. 

### Architectural Patterns:
    MVC (Model-View-Controller) is the most prominent, used by frameworks like Laravel and Symfony.
    Dependency Injection (DI): Crucial for modern PHP unit testing and decoupling.
    Data Access Patterns: Includes Data Access Object (DAO), Repository, and Data Mapper patterns.
    
### Other PHP Patterns: 
    Specification pattern, Registry, and Fluent Interface.
