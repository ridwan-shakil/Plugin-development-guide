# 🧠 Rule #1: Decide the PLUGIN IDENTITY before code

## Before writing code, lock these forever: ( Generic names/slug are not accepted )
      Plugin slug	 =  Unique, brand-based
      Text domain	 =  EXACT slug
      Folder name	 =  slug
      Main file		 =  slug.php
      Prefix		   =  Short brand prefix
      Namespace		 =  Brand/FolderStructure
      
      Plugin name  =  Can be changed anytime
