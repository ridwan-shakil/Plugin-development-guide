# 🧠 Rule #1: Decide the PLUGIN IDENTITY before code

## Before writing code, lock these forever: ( Generic names/slug are not accepted )
      Plugin slug	 =  Unique, brand-based   => eg: plugmint-{plugin-name}
      slug = text-domain = Folder name =  Main file.php	
      Prefix	 =  Short brand prefix OR plugin name shortform
      Namespace	 =  Brand/FolderStructure
      
      Plugin name  =  Can be changed anytime
