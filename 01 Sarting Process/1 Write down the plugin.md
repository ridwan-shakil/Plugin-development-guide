NOTES:
  1) Ensure that the plugin "slug" is unique and doesn't exixts.     (may use brand name to make unique)
  2) Plugin name & text-domain & slug will be same       (slug will be generated from your first submited plugin name)
  3) slug & text-domain will always be same        ( Plugin name can be changed )
  4) Prefix everything with unique 4 letter word not a meaningfull generic word.


-----------------
## First write the plugin in english before coding :
      what featurs will be there
      how the designs will be 
      how the featurs are going to work 
      what technologies are going to be used (if any packages are needed or not)
      when the full plugin is write down perfectly > take approval from client (if it's ok or not )
