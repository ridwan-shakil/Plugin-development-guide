1) Data flow
2) Todo app building ( CRUD , Search, Filters)
3) Build your confidance (Don't code blindly)

ðŸ§  Logic Building Mindset
Whenever you write jQuery for WP:
    Step 1: Where does the flow start? (event)
    Step 2: What data do I need? (input values, IDs, etc.)
    Step 3: Who do I send it to? (AJAX â†’ PHP action)
    Step 4: What responses can I expect? (true/false, success/error)
    Step 5: How should the UI react? (show/hide, add class, display message)
