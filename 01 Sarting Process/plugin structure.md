# Core idea (memorize this)
    includes/ = shared, core, reusable logic, used by both admin & frontend
    admin/ = WordPress dashboard (wp-admin) only
    frontend/ = public site only

### for tiny plugins use "includes" folder only
### for medium → large plugins : you can use "includes, admin, frontend" folders to separate codes
